Openstack Monitor
=================
Cloud computing platforms are complex systems with many VMs which in turn
run different applications. Since applications have varying needs, different VMs
are configured differently. The goal of this project is to write a simple tool that
is inspired by Amazon Trusted Advisor that is used in Amazon’s EC2 cloud to
continuously monitor a cloud deployment and make recommendations on how to
improve security, resource usage, etc for various VMs by analyzing the hypervisor.
The project involves setting up OpenStack on two nodes, setting up hypervisors and
virtual machines and then writing a tool that uses the OpenStack API as well as
the hypervisor API to gather various statistics that are then analyzed to provide
recommendations.

In this project we focus on monitoring the statistics based on which we provide re-
source utilization recommendations.The hypervisor that is being used here is KVM.
Alerts are provided to the user when any high utilization or low utilization thresholds
are hit. Recommendations are provided to the user to move machines to different
nodes if the performance of the setup as a whole improves as a result of VM migra-
tion.
